I need some help figuring this out. I'd like the source code to be under the standard MIT LICENSE, but if the source code is modified, it would prohibit the use of the brand Simple Comment, or prohibit branding the content system as Simple Comment. The idea is that "powered by Simple Comment" would be a symbol of trust and transparency. Are there any open source LICENSE that do that?
