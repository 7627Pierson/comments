## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please [open a new issue](https://github.com/rendall/simple-comment/issues/new) with this information:

- describing in general terms the nature of the vulnerability if possible, or that there is a vulnerability at all if not, and
- the best way to contact you privately.

We'll be in touch quickly.
